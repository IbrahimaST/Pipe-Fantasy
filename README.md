<h6>Racket Game Project</h6>
<p align="center">In this project, I created and implemented a simplified version of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/win3_PipeDr3x">Pipe Dream</a> game. It is a simulation in which you connect pipes placed on a grid to allow the green goo to flow through the pipes until reaching an eventual end point from the incoming chain of pipes.</p>

<p>This code cannot be used for college assignments. I value keeping this code on github as part of my portfolio, but as you all know, <b>plagiarism is bad</b>. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing and designing this project and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.</p>
